While removing missing data entirely maybe a correct approach in many situations, this may result in a lot of information being omitted from your models.

You may find categorical columns where the missing value is a valid piece of information in itself, such as someone refusing to answer a question in a survey. In these cases, you can fill all missing values with a new category entirely, for example 'No response given'.

# Print the count of occurrences
print(so_survey_df['Gender'].value_counts())

-----------------------------------------------
# Replace missing values
so_survey_df['Gender'].fillna('Not Given', inplace=True)
